##How I Started the Task

When I first saw Task 4, I wasn’t exactly sure what to do. So I started by searching on Google to understand what “model implementation and evaluation” actually meant. I read some articles and blog posts to get a basic idea of how machine learning works — especially how we take a dataset, train a model, and then test how well it performs.

 Learning and Exploring

Once I had a rough idea, I used GrapeScope to understand the dataset better, especially through graphs and statistics. It helped me explore the data before jumping into the code. I also watched YouTube tutorials related to machine learning using Python, which explained each step clearly — from importing the libraries to training and evaluating the model.

These videos really helped me understand the logic behind each step, since I’m still a beginner and trying to build confidence with every task.

 Tools and Technologies I Used

Here’s what I used to complete the task:

Google – To understand the task and search for solutions

GrapeScope – For quick data understanding and visual exploration

YouTube – To learn how to write the code step-by-step

Jupyter Notebook – To write and run my Python code

pandas and numpy – For handling the dataset

matplotlib and seaborn – For creating basic visualizations

scikit-learn – For training and evaluating the machine learning model


 Steps I Followed in My Notebook

1. Imported the necessary libraries


2. Loaded the dataset into the notebook


3. Cleaned the data and handled missing values if any


4. Split the data into training and testing sets


5. Chose a simple model (like Logistic Regression or Decision Tree)


6. Trained the model on the training set


7. Evaluated it using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report


8. Added some basic plots to visualize the results



 What I Learned

How to build a simple machine learning model from scratch

The importance of understanding the data before training

How to evaluate the model’s performance using proper metrics

That it's okay to search online and learn step by step – it’s part of the process!


 Final Deliverable

My final work for Task 4 is a Jupyter Notebook that includes:

Data preprocessing

Model building and training

Performance evaluation

Comments to explain each step clearly


This task helped me get more comfortable with machine learning, and I’m excited to keep learning more from here.
